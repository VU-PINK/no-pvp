# no-pvp
Puts those pesky humans in one team

# Config
There is a config file in vu-no-pvp/ext/server/config.lua
Here you can configure the team mode and squad size

The teamMode allows you to choose how the human team is selected every round
1 = random team
2 = swapped teams (This will swap the teams between rounds, if humans were US in the last round, they'll get RU in the next) 
3 = Always US
4 = Always RU

Set squadSize equal to the squad size you've configured in your server's startup.txt
Vanilla default = 4
